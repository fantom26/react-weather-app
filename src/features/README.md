# Features

The `features` folder is a critical component of our application architecture, designed following the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) methodology. This folder contains all the specific features or functionalities of the application, each encapsulated within its own module. This modular approach promotes maintainability, reusability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Purpose

The `features` folder is intended to group related functionalities, typically organized around specific business use cases or user interactions. Each feature can include its components, hooks, styles, and any related logic, making it easy to develop and manage the applicationâ€™s features independently.
