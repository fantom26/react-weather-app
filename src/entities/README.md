# Entities

The `entities` folder is an essential part of our application architecture, following the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) methodology. It is responsible for managing the core business logic and data models that represent the main entities within the application. Each entity encapsulates relevant data and associated operations, promoting a clear separation of concerns.

## Purpose

Entities are the heart of our application's domain logic. They define the data structure, enforce business rules, and provide methods for data manipulation. By organizing our code in this way, we enhance maintainability, readability, and testability.
