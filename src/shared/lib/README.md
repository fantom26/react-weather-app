# Shared Library

The `shared/lib` folder contains utility functions, helper methods, and other library code that can be reused across various parts of the application. This folder serves as a central place for shared logic that doesn't fit neatly into components, hooks, or features, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `shared/lib` folder is to provide a collection of generic, reusable functions and utilities that can simplify code in various features and components. By encapsulating common functionality in this folder, you can avoid code duplication and ensure consistent behavior across your application.
