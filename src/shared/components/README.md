# Shared Components

The `shared/components` folder contains reusable React components that can be utilized across different features and layouts in the application. This structure promotes code reusability, consistency, and easier maintenance by providing a centralized library of components.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `shared/components` folder is to house generic UI components that are not specific to any one feature. These components can be used throughout the application, ensuring consistency in design and behavior.
