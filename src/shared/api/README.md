# Shared API

The `shared/api` folder contains all the API-related functionality of our application, providing a centralized and organized way to handle communication with external services. This structure promotes reusability and maintainability of API logic across different features and components in the application.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `shared/api` folder is to define and manage all API requests and responses. This encapsulation ensures that any changes to the API can be made in one place, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.
