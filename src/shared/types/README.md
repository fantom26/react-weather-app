# Shared Types

The `shared/types` folder contains TypeScript type definitions, interfaces, and enums that are shared across different parts of the application. This folder serves as a central place for type definitions that ensure consistency and type safety throughout the application, making it easier to manage and understand data structures used across various features.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `shared/types` folder is to provide a collection of reusable types and interfaces that can be shared among different components, hooks, and features. By centralizing type definitions, you promote consistency and reduce the risk of type mismatches across your application.
