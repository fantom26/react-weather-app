# Shared Hooks

The `shared/hooks` folder contains custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic and state management functionalities. These hooks can be used across various components and features within the application, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `shared/hooks` folder is to centralize commonly used hooks, making them easily accessible throughout the application. By creating custom hooks, you can abstract complex logic and share it among different components, enhancing maintainability and readability.
