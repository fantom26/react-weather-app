# Shared Config

The `shared/config` folder contains configuration files and settings that are used throughout the application. This includes environment variables, routing configurations, API endpoints, and any other shared settings that impact the application's behavior.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `shared/config` folder is to centralize configuration-related code, making it easier to manage and maintain. By having all configurations in one place, you can easily modify settings without having to search through the entire codebase.
